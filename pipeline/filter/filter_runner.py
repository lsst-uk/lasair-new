"""
Filter process runner. Sends args to its child and logs the outputs.
It will run continously, running batch after batch. Each batch is a run of the 
child program filter.py.

The runner needs a lockfile -- usually as ~ubuntu/lockfile. If not present
the runner continues, but looking for a lockfile every few minutes.

A SIGTERM is handled and passed to the child process, which finishes the batch
and exits cleanly. The SIGTERM also cause this runner process to exit,
which is different from the lockfile check.

Usage:
    ingest.py [--maxalert=MAX]
              [--group_id=GID]
              [--topic_in=TIN]

Options:
    --maxalert=MAX     Number of alerts to process, default is infinite
    --group_id=GID     Group ID for kafka, default is from settings
    --topic_in=TIN     Kafka topic to use, or
