**[How to get a Lasair account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekjl5DpLV_Q)**

**[How to make a filter for Lasair alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9vCVXsABg)**

* How to write a filter in a SQL-like language with SELECT and WHERE. You can also include watchlists (find alerts that happened at one of my sources), watchmaps (alerts withing a special area of the sky), and annotations (alerts that an external annotator has flagged).

**[How to make a watchlist for Lasair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aug9xxJFsqI)**

* A watchlist is a set of special places in the sky -- my favourite sources. This video is how to create a watchlist from a file of simple format (RA, Dec, Name), how to make that file from [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR). Once you have a watchlist, you can use it in a Lasair filter to select alerts from your favourite sources.

**[How to make a watchmap for Lasair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoVEeWGOum0)**

* A watchmap is an area of the sky defined by a [MOC](https://cds-astro.github.io/mocpy/). This video shows how to create a watchmap from such a file, and how to build the file. Once you have a watchmap, you can use it in a Lasair filter to select alerts from your favourite area of the sky.
