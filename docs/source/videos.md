The front page of Lasair, and all the goodies to be found on the page of a specific 
astronomical object.

* [How to get a Lasair account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekjl5DpLV_Q)  
You just need a working email to get an account. Then you can create and save filters, watchlists, watchmaps, and run real-time streaming from your filter.

* [How to make a filter for Lasair alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9vCVXsABg)  
How to write a filter in a SQL-like language with SELECT and WHERE. You can also include watchlists (find alerts that happened at one of my sources), watchmaps (alerts withing a special area of the sky), and annotations (alerts that an external annotator has flagged).

* [How to make a watchlist for Lasair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aug9xxJFsqI)  
A watchlist is a set of special places in the sky -- my favourite sources. This video is how to create a watchlist from a file of simple format (RA, Dec, Name), how to make that file from
[Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR). Once you have a watchlist, you can use it in a Lasair filter to select alerts from your favourite sources.

* [How to make a watchmap for Lasair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoVEeWGOum0)  
A watchmap is an area of the sky defined by a [MOC](https://cds-astro.github.io/mocpy/). This video shows how to create a watchmap from such a file, and how to build the file. Once you have a watchmap, you can use it in a Lasair filter to select alerts from your favourite area of the sky.
