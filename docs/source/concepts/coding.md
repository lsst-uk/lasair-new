# Coding with Lasair

There is a [python client for Lasair ](https://pypi.org/project/lasair/). 
The documenation is in the page [Lasair Client](../core_functions/client.html).

Its usage is explained in the page [Lasair API](../core_functions/rest-api.html).

There are a number of [python notebooks](../core_functions/python-notebooks.html) that show how
to use the Lasair client.
