(1) Took the schema file
https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/ztf-avro-alert/blob/master/schema/fp_hist.avsc
wrote code to convert to cassandra CREATE TABLE

- Change string to ascii, change long to bigint
- add in extra objectId attribute that will come from the alert
- primary key is objectId,jd

(2) Put all the sample alerts into kafka
Fetch https://caltech.box.com/s/09wdqwg3xv6kitq4k8na5qn01gw62pxc
which is a .tar.gz of 24,000 avro files

each is about 65kbyte including schema
code avro2kafka --> topic forcedphot_schema
